# wraps Cocci.full_engine only: the ~3s of iso loading and rule parsing, and any
# wait on I/O, are outside it. Work unit, because given a file list spatch
# treats the whole list as one, and only a directory (--all-files) splits per
# file.
#
# 60 against a worst measured file of 0.5 CPU-seconds is margin for the two
# things that move billed CPU -- machine load and core speed -- not for
# expensive rules. docs/WRITING_RULES.md -> "The rule exceeds its time budget"
# carries the numbers.
SPATCH_TIMEOUT = 60

# The outer bound, and the only one that sees what a CPU budget structurally
# cannot: a stalled read, a deadlocked parmap child, a rule parse that never
# returns. It is also the coarser statement of the same standard -- no single
# spatch run has any business taking five minutes, whole-tree scan included, and
# one that does is a rule to rewrite rather than a budget to raise. The slowest
# --all-files scan of the whole rule set measures 43s wall / 37s CPU, so this
# leaves ~7x for slower hardware. 0 disables it, as it does for spatch.
SPATCH_WALL_TIMEOUT = 300

# spatch is OCaml, and its cost on a rule's own files is dominated by allocating
# and collecting the parsed AST. space_overhead is how much garbage the major
# collector tolerates before it works, so raising it buys wall-clock with memory
# -- and the memory it spends is small at this shape: peak RSS per spatch stays
# ~40-46MB whatever the setting, because a rule sees a handful of files. Measured
# against the bundled cvehound-spatch build (1.3.2 on OCaml 5.3) on the fast
# suite (idle 32-thread box, --no-result-cache, paired runs): 56.0s
# default, 49.4s at o=800, 47.9s at o=1600, 47.2s at o=3200 -- so 1600 sits where
# the curve flattens. Do not raise the minor heap (s=) with it: every variant
# tried was slower, and a large one triples system time under 32-way concurrency.
#
# Whole-tree scans (--all-files) barely move: handed a directory spatch spends
# its time on the token prefilter, scanning every file in the tree for the
# rule's literals, and parses almost nothing. There is no AST there to collect.
