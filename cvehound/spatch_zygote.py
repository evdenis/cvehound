"""The zygote transport for spatch, selected by --zygote.

One `spatch --zygote` server per client process, spawned lazily on first use --
in a scan worker that is after install_sandbox(), so the server and every
request child inherit the confinement. The server holds the warm state (runtime
init, standard.iso parse, standard.h extraction) and forks a child per request.

Requests and status replies travel over the server's stdin/stdout as
length-prefixed frames; the request's own stdout/stderr are written by the
child to files in the caller-owned capture directory, so they survive a
wall-timeout SIGKILL, unlike a pipe. Frame layout (u32 big-endian lengths):
request = u32 field count, then per field u32 length + bytes, the fields being
capture dir, decimal env-entry count, env entries, spatch argv tail;
reply = u32 length + "exit <n>" or "signal <n>".

The OCaml runtime reads OCAMLRUNPARAM once at server start, so the first
request's environment becomes the server's; each later request carries only the
entries that differ from it, which the server putenv()s into the request child.
Entries can be added or changed per request, never removed -- acceptable
because _spatch_env only ever adds to os.environ.
