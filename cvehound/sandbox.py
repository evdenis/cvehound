"""Bound what a scan may touch, the way the timeouts bound how long it may run.

A scan hands an untrusted source tree to spatch -- a large OCaml binary driven by
.cocci rules that `cvehound update` fetches over the network -- and spatch is not
a leaf process. Traced under this tool's own argv it shells out:

    /bin/sh -c "cd DIR > /dev/null; git grep -l -w TOKEN -- '*.[ch]'"   per rule token
    /bin/sh -c "find DIR -type f -name '*.[ch]' ..."                    non-git trees
    /bin/sh -c "rm -rf TMPDIR"                                          --tmp-dir cleanup
    /bin/sh -c "diff -u -p ..."                                         on a match

None of that needs the user's ssh keys, their home directory, or a socket. Landlock
takes away the filesystem and TCP; seccomp takes away the syscalls Landlock cannot
express (UDP, netlink, io_uring, ptrace, namespaces). Both are inherited across fork
and execve, so installing once in the parent covers the worker pool, spatch, and
everything spatch runs.

Two properties drive the shape of this module:

Landlock is irreversible. Every way of *not* sandboxing has to be decided before
landlock_restrict_self, which is why apply() degrades but self_test() aborts.

A too-tight policy is silent. Denied a path it needs, spatch reports "0 files match"
and exits 0 -- a missed CVE that looks exactly like a clean tree. That is the failure
mode this module exists to avoid, so self_test() proves the allowed set positively
rather than trusting that the rules were built right.
